  The Hacking project is an intensive tech bootcamp that works without teacher nor school. The strength of THP is its community. Indeed, THP relies on peer-learning to pass on skills and knowledges. To know more, click on the link on the banner.

  He must reach the top of the stairs to escape
  At the beginning of the game your start totally down, and 10 stairs seperate you from the top
  You have control over your character movement by launching the dice
  If you get 5 or 6, your character goes up 1 stair.

  And if you get 2, 3, or 4, nothing happens
